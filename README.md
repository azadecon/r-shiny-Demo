# PDS Bihar API Data Visualizer

This Shiny app fetches and visualizes transaction data from the **Public Distribution System (PDS) Bihar** portal. It provides interactive plots and summary statistics for selected districts, focusing on **card transactions**, **portability**, and **portability as a share of total transactions**.
